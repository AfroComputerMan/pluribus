# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-05)

**Core value:** Run multiple AI agents simultaneously across repos and have full control over every one of them
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Provider Abstraction

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Provider Abstraction)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-05 — Completed Plan 01-01 (Provider Type System)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 6%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-provider-abstraction | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (3min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Claude CLI adapter being removed (PROV-06) in favor of Agent SDK -- CLI has concurrent session corruption issues
- [Roadmap]: Persistence requirements (PERS-01/02/03) grouped with Phase 2 since multi-agent registry is the first phase needing concurrent DB writes
- [Roadmap]: Streaming and intervention controls (ORCH-04/05/06/07) separated from registry as Phase 3 -- registry must exist before real-time streaming layer
- [01-01]: Used claude-stream-sh for OS-level PID kills (kill command not in Tauri shell permissions, sh is)
- [01-01]: Dual kill strategy: Child.kill() for current session, OS kill for crash-recovery orphans

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR support unverified -- may affect per-agent config isolation (PROV-07)
- [Research]: Agent SDK 12s cold-start per query() call -- no known workaround
- [Research]: assistant-ui multi-runtime memory leaks -- needs profiling in Phase 4
